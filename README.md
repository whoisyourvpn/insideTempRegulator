# Temperature Control Simulation

## Overview
This repository contains a simple C++ program that simulates a temperature control system. It's designed as an educational tool to demonstrate basic programming concepts in C++, including loops, conditional statements, user input, and function usage.

## How to Use
To run the program, simply compile the C++ code and execute the resulting binary. The program will prompt you to input outside and inside temperatures and will simulate a heating system based on these inputs.
